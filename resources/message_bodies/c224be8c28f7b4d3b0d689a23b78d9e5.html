His name if Mr. Greg Aniston and he has readily accepted our offer to lead the sales and marketing team. Mr. Aniston is a well known marketing expert and has agreed to give in his best to our company ‘Laila Inc.’
Ever since Mr. Tim West left the job position due to personal reasons, this position has been up for grabs. We finally found our man in Mr. Aniston. He has worked for ‘Pearl footwear’ for over 7 years as the marketing manager and won several acclaims and even wrote a column for this company in the ‘Marketing times’ newspaper. He is extremely dedicated to his work and is very hard working. He can be reached easily and has been known to build a good rapport with fellow colleagues and employees.
