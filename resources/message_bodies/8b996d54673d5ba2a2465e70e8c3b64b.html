<p>This is to bring to your notice that we have hired a new marketing manager in our company to lead the marketing department of our company. His name if Mr. Greg Aniston and he has readily accepted our offer to lead the sales and marketing team. Mr. Aniston is a well known marketing expert and has agreed to give in his best to our company ‘Laila Inc.’</p>

<p>Ever since Mr. Tim West left the job position due to personal reasons, this position has been up for grabs. We finally found our man in Mr. Aniston. He has worked for ‘Pearl footwear’ for over 7 years as the marketing manager and won several acclaims and even wrote a column for this company in the ‘Marketing times’ newspaper. He is extremely dedicated to his work and is very hard working. He can be reached easily and has been known to build a good rapport with fellow colleagues and employees.</p>

<p>We are conducting a welcome ceremony for Mr. Greg Aniston on the 20th of this month and would appreciate maximum attendance. We hope you pay full adjustment and accommodation to our new marketing manager in the times to come so that we gets comfortable in this company and is therefore able to give his best performance.</p>

<p>Hope to see you at the welcome party at 5 pm in the company seminar room on 20th of this month.</p>

<p>Bill Black</p>
